## Overview

**Elmfire.jl** is a pure Julia implementation of the ELMFIRE (Eulerian Level Set Model of FIRE spread) wildfire simulation model. It provides high-performance fire spread modeling with support for:

- **Rothermel Surface Fire Spread Model** - Industry-standard fire behavior calculations
- **Level Set Method** - Efficient fire front propagation using the Eulerian approach
- **Crown Fire Modeling** - Passive and active crown fire transitions
- **Ember Transport (Spotting)** - Stochastic ember generation and transport
- **Weather Interpolation** - Spatially and temporally varying weather conditions
- **Monte Carlo Ensembles** - Probabilistic fire forecasting with parallel execution
- **WUI (Wildland-Urban Interface) Models** - Building ignition and urban fire spread
- **Suppression Models** - Fire containment line construction and resource management
- **Geospatial I/O** - GeoTIFF reading/writing for integration with GIS workflows

## Features

### Multi-Precision Support

Elmfire.jl supports both `Float64` (default) and `Float32` precision throughout the entire codebase, allowing you to trade off numerical precision for memory efficiency and potentially faster computation on certain hardware.

### High Performance

- **Narrow Band Method** - Only computes fire spread near the active fire front
- **Multi-threaded Ensemble Runs** - Parallel execution of Monte Carlo simulations
- **Efficient Memory Layout** - Column-major arrays optimized for Julia

### Comprehensive Fire Behavior

- 53 standard FBFM (Fire Behavior Fuel Models) included
- Custom fuel model support
- Dynamic fuel moisture effects
- Slope and aspect terrain effects
- Wind-driven elliptical spread patterns

## Quick Start

```julia
using Elmfire

# Create a fire simulation state (100x100 grid, 30ft cells)
state = FireState{Float64}(100, 100, 30.0)

# Create standard fuel model table
fuel_table = create_standard_fuel_table(Float64)

# Set weather conditions
weather = ConstantWeather{Float64}(
    wind_speed_mph = 15.0,
    wind_direction = 270.0,  # From west
    M1 = 0.06,   # 6% 1-hr fuel moisture
    M10 = 0.08,
    M100 = 0.10,
    MLH = 0.60,
    MLW = 0.90
)

# Ignite at center
ignite!(state, 50, 50, 0.0)

# Run for 60 minutes
simulate_uniform!(state, 1, fuel_table, weather, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 60.0)

# Get results
println("Burned area: ", get_burned_area_acres(state), " acres")
```
